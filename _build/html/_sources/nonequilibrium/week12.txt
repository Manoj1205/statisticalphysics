Propagator
----------------------------

To solve master equation, we usually find out the propagator :math:`\Pi(x-x',t)`. For simple discrete master equation, we have the propagator with the form :math:`I_m(2Ft)e^{-2Ft}`.

For continuous master equation which is the diffusion equation, given the initial distribution, it evolves according to

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(x,t) = \zeta \frac{\partial}{\partial x} P(x,t) + D \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} P(x,t) .


Then after infinite time, we have the final distribution.

**As long as the system has translational or rotational invariance, we can use Fourier transform to reduce the higher order derivatives to solve the equation.**

For :math:`\zeta =0`, there is only diffusion, so we have translational invariance. Fourier transform for continuous equation is

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial x} e^{ikx}=ike^{ikx} &\implies \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \to ik \\
   \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} e^{ikx} = -k^2 e^{ikx} & \implies \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \to -k^2

So we can write down the transformed equation right away (for :math:`\zeta=0` case).

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}P^k = -D k^2 P^k

and the solution to this equation is

.. math::
   P^k(t) = P^k(0) e^{-D k^2 t} .


To find out the propagator, we complete the square,

.. math::
   P(x,t) & = \int P(k,0) e^{-Dk^2t+ikx} dk \\
   & = \int P(k,0) e^{-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}} e^{-Dt(k-\frac{ix}{2Dt})^2 }dk \\
   & = e^{-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}  \int P(k,0) e^{-Dt(k-\frac{ix}{2Dt})^2 }dk




The propagator is finally

.. math::
   \Pi(x,t) = \frac{e^{-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}

.. warning::
   Somehow I can't derive it. Stupid.


.. hint::
   There might be sigularity in the propagator. One example of it is logorithm sigularity in 2D.



Bias in Master Equation
-------------------------


When :math:`\zeta\neq 0`, the first term on RHS is a decay or viscous term.

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}P(x,t) = \zeta \frac{\partial}{\partial x}P(x,t) + D\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}P(x,t)

.. hint::
   To check the properties of :math:`\zeta`, set :math:`D=0`.

   .. math::
      \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P = \zeta \frac{\partial}{\partial x} P \Rightarrow P\propto e^{k_w(\omega + \zeta t)}


   So we know that when :math:`k_w > 0`,

   1. :math:`\zeta > 0` : exponential grow;
   2. :math:`\zeta < 0` : decay



We can Fourier transform then complete the square to solve this kind of problem.

.. hint::
   This formalism is very much like the :highlit:`Gauge Transformation`. We define a new derivative

   .. math::
      \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \to \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \Gamma(x)

   Then we put this new derivative into diffusion equation,

   .. math::
      & \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(x,t) = D\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} P(x,t) \\
      \to & \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(x,t) = D \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} P(x,t) + 2\Gamma\frac{\partial}{\partial x}P(x,t) \right) + D\left( P\left( 2\Gamma^2 + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Gamma \right) \right)

   Now we define :math:`\zeta := 2\Gamma`, and let :math:`2\Gamma^2 + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Gamma`. [1]_  The diffusion equation under this kind of transformation becomes the one we need.

   :highlit:`Does it imply that the diffusion equation and gauge transformation are related?`

   We might find some symmetry using this method.




Smoluchowski Equation
-----------------------

   Probability distribution with an attraction point.

If we have some potential with a mininum point, then the motion of particles will be attracted to this minimum point. With the force in mind, we can write down the master equation, which is the :math:`\zeta \neq 0` case,

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(x,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial U(x)}{\partial x} P(x,t)  \right) + D \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} P(x,t) .


This equation is called the Smoluchowski equation.

A very simple case is

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(x,t) = \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x P(x,t)  \right) + D \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} P(x,t) .

which corresponds to a quadrople potential :math:`U(x) = \gamma x^2/2`.

.. hint::
   We have :highlit:`methods of characteristics` to solve such partial differential equations.


We can also use Fourier transform to solve the problem. However, we will only get

.. math::
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t} P^k = \cdots \frac{\partial}{\partial k} P^k  + \cdots k^2 P^k

and the propagator is

.. math::
   \Pi(x,x',t) = \frac{e^{-(x - x' \exp(-\gamma t))^2}{4D\mathscr T(t)} }{\sqrt{4 \pi D \mathscr T(t)}}


where :math:`\mathscr T(t) = \frac{1-e^{-2\gamma t}}{2\gamma}`.
