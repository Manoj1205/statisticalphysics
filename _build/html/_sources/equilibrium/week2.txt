Behaviors of functions
------------------------

1. Tanh(x)

   Tanh(x) from wolfram alpha

2. :math:`1-exp(-x)`

   :align: center


3. :math:`cosh(1/x)-1/x`

   :align: center

4. :math:`1/(1+1/x)`

.. image:: ../_static/voc/fraction1.jpg
   :align: center

.. note::
   An example of this :math:`1/(1+1/x)` is the modified gas model.

   .. math::
      P (V - b) = N k T

   We can find out :math:`1/V`, which is

   .. math::
      \frac{1}{V} = \frac{1}{b+\frac{N k T}{P}}

   Now we can plot out :math:`\frac{1}{V} ~ P` and it shows a behavior just like :math:`1/(1+1/x)`.


.. note::
   To see the true nature of graphs, make quantities dimensionless. This is also true for theoretical derivations. Dimensionless equations can reveal more.


Behavior of Boltzmann factor.

   :align: center

.. note::
   The nth derivative of this function is always 0 at x=0, for all finite n. Then how does it rise? The only thing I can say is that we are actually dealing with infinite n.

Specific Heat
----------------


.. math::
   C = \frac{d}{T}\langle E \rangle

Check the behavior of specific heat,

1. Is there a Discontinuity?
2. Constant?
3. Blow up?
4. Converge?

Specific heat can be used for second order phase transition. An simple example of this is Landau theory.




Partition Function
--------------------

For a given Hamiltonian H, the (classical) partition function Z is

.. math::
   Z = \int d q \int d x e^{-\beta H}

A simple example is the Harmonic Oscillator,

.. math::
   H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} q x^2

The partition function

.. math::
   Z = \int e^{-\beta p^2/(2m)} d q \int  e^{-\beta \frac{1}{2} q x^2 } d x  = 2\pi \sqrt{m/q} \frac{1}{\beta}


Energy

.. math::
   E = \frac{1}{Z} \int \int e^{-\beta p^2/(2m)}   e^{-\beta \frac{1}{2} q x^2 }  H d p d x  = \cdots = k_B T

(This result is obvious if we think about equipartition theorem.)


A more clever approach for the energy is to take the derivative of partition function over :math:`\beta`, which exactly is

.. math::
   \langle E \rangle = -\frac{\partial }{\partial \beta } \ln Z

In our simple case,

.. math::
   \ln Z = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \left(\ln (k_B T) + \mathrm{Some Constant} \right)= k_B T



This is the power of partition function. To continue the SHO example, we find the specific heat is

.. math::
   C = k_B


.. note::
   This result has nothing to do with the detail of the SHO, no matter what mass they have, no matter what potential constant :math:`q` they have, no matter what kind of initial state they have. All the characteristic quantities of SHO are irrelevant. Why? Mathematically, it's because we have Gaussian integral here. **But what is the physics behind this?** Basicly this classical limit is a high temperature limit. 




Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
----------------------------

Quantum HO tells us the eigen energy

.. math::
   E_n  = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega

where :math:`\omega = \sqrt{ k/m }`.

Partition function

.. math::
   Z = \sum_n e^{-\beta E_n} = \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega }} { 1 - e^{- \beta \hbar \omega} } = \frac{1}{2}  \sinh(\beta \hbar \omega/2)

Energy

.. math::
   \langle E \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial\beta} \ln Z =  \hbar \omega \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\exp(\beta\hbar\omega) - 1} \right) 

Specific heat

.. math::
   C = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \langle E\rangle = k_B (\beta \hbar \omega)^2 \frac{\exp(\beta \hbar \omega)}{ (\exp(\beta \hbar \omega) - 1)^2 }


This specific heat behaves like this.

   :align: center

Though we have infinite energy levels, the specific heat won't blow up because the probability of a high energy level state is very small.




Density of States
-----------------------



.. note::
   Free energy

   .. math::
      A = U - T S

   In another way,

   .. math::
      A = - k_B T \ln Z

   As long as we find out partition function, all thermodynamics quantities are solved, including entropy.

   .. math::
      S = -k_B \beta  \left(T \ln Z - \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \ln Z \right)



Specific heat is very different in 1D, 2D, 3D even for similar Hamiltonian. In the case of dipole systems, this is because for 1D, there discrete energy levels, for 2D and 3D energy levels fill up the gap. But what's the difference between 2D and 3D? Obviously the degeneracies are different.

Generally, 

.. math::
   Z = \int g(E) e^{-\beta E}\mathrm d E

where :math:`g(E)` is the density of states.


Calculation of DoS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


QM free particle in a 2D box.

In the momentum (wave number) space, all possible states are distributed on a grid.

.. image:: images/2DDos.png
   :align: center


How do we calculate the DoS? For a given E, we have :math:`k_x^2 + k_y^2 = \mathrm{Constant} E`. The # of states between :math:`E ~ E + \mathrm d E` is just the area of it divided by the area of each grid box.

.. math::
   N = \frac{d V_k}{d V_0} = \frac{2\pi k d k}{\frac{2\pi}{L_x} \frac{2\pi}{L_y} } \equiv g(E) d E


DoS :math:`g(E)` is 

.. math::
   g(E) = \frac{ 2\pi k }{\frac{d E}{d k}} \frac{L_x L_y}{(2\pi)^2}

In the laguage of physics,

.. math::
   g(E) = \frac{\mathrm{area of } E ~ d E}{|\nabla_k E|} \frac{\mathrm{Volume of the box} }{(2\pi)^d}

where :math:`d` is the dimension of the system or box.

Gradient of energy gives us the spread out or dispersion.

To sum up, the quantities that determines the DoS are,

* :math:`E(k)`
* :math:`n`: dimension
* :math:`V`: volume of the box (important in QM because this sets the boundary conditions)


Examples of DoS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. 2D free particle in a box with length :math:`L`
   
   .. math::
      \frac{d E}{d k} = \frac{d}{d k}\left( \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \right) = \frac{\hbar^2 k}{m}
   
   Thus we have,

   .. math::
      g(E) = \frac{2\pi k }{\frac{\hbar^2 k}{m}} \frac{L^2}{(2\pi)^2} = (\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{m}{\hbar^2})L^2

2. 3D free particle in a box with length :math:`L`

   .. math::
      \frac{d E}{d k} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}
   
   DoS

   .. math::
      g(E) = \frac{m}{\hbar^2} \frac{L^3}{2\pi^2} k

   This is :math:`k` dependent.

3. 1D
   
   .. math::
      g(E) = \frac{1}{k} \frac{m L}{2\pi \hbar^2}


.. note::
   These results are so different. For 1D system, the higher energy of the system is, the small DoS is. 2D DoS doesn't depend on energy. 3D is proportional to the square root of energy.

   DoS is very important in quantum systems because quantization can make strange DoS. In classical systems without quantization, DoS is always some kind of constant.




Partition Function and DoS
----------------------------


Thermal wavelength is defined as

.. math::
   \lambda_T = \frac{\hbar}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi m k_B T } }

For 1 particle in 3D box,

.. math::
   Z_1 = \frac{V}{\lambda_T^3}


It's obvious that for a N particles system without interaction between particles, :math:`Z_N  = (Z_1)^N`. Free energy

.. math::
   A = -k_B T \ln (Z_N) = -k_B T N \ln Z_1 = -k_B T N (\ln V - 3\ln \lambda_T)

.. note::
   This quantity is neither intensive nor extensive! If we combine two exactly same system, then we won't have twice of the free energy. It's called Gibbs mixing paradox.
