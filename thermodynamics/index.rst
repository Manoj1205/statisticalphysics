   :class: toggle

   1. Thermodynamic variables: extensive, intensive, neither;
   2. Equation of state;
   3. Four fundamental laws of thermodynamics;
   4. Thermodynamics potentials;
   5. Phase transitions;
   6. Response;
   7. Stability;

In some sense, thermodynamics is a theory that deals with black boxes. We deal with a large collection of one type of serveral types of particles. Then we manipulate some properties of the system and observing the changes.
