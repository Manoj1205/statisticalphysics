Macroscopic States and Microscropic State
============================================================

For a system of :math:`N` particles, the microscopic states (microstates) are the states of all the particles in phase space, i.e., points in :math:`\Gamma` space. The macroscopic states (macrostates) are the coarse grained information of the microstates. For example, a macrostate could be a distribution of single particle energy states. It will also be explained in the next section :ref:`most-probable-distribution`.
