Why does equilibrium state exists?
=====================================

In equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theories predict only one value for the thermodynamic observables. No variance or confidential level is given.

In experiments, the measured observables of equilibrum systems have quite small variance. Naturally, we assumed the theoretical values for the observables to be one fixed value and treat the variances as experimental uncertaintities. However, this is not accurate. Statistically speaking macroscopic systems have fluctuating observables, though tiny enough to be ignored.

In most cases, we merely confine a few macroscopic observables. Why does equilibrium state exist?
