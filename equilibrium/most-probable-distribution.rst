Equal A Prior Probability
------------------------------------


.. admonition:: Equal A Prior Probability
   :class: note

   For systems with enormous number of particles, we observe their macroscopic properties such as energies, pressure in experiments. But we have very limited information about the internal structure. The principle proposed by Boltzmann is that all these different possible configurations of microstructure are equally distributed, a.k.a., principle of equal *a prior* probabilities.

   We can think about this using two spin system.

      Spin system

   With an external magnetic field, the energy of the system is determined by

   .. math::
      J s_1 s_2 + (s_1  + s_2) B,

   where :math:`s_i=\pm 1`. We find that the second row of the configurations shows two different configurations that have the same energy. How do we determine the probability of these two configurations? In principle, we need more information. But we assume that the two spins are exactly the same with same properties. Then we do we need to distinguish the two configurations anyways. The is a very simple explanation of the equal *a prior* probability.
